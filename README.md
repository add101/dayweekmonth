# Day Week Month Planner 

A simple, responsive React-based planner offering **Day**, **Week**, and **Month** views. This project aids organization, it's a simple scheduling app, with plans for future feature enhancement.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-View Planning:** Seamlessly switch between **Day**, **Week**, and **Month** views for flexible schedule management.

* **Intuitive Navigation:** Navigate through time with forward and backward controls.

* **Event Management:** Add, edit, and delete events with customizable titles, descriptions, and times.

* **Dark Mode Toggle:** Built-in dark mode with a toggle button (sun/moon icon) for comfortable viewing.


## üöÄ Technologies Used

This project is primarily built using modern web technologies:

* **React (JavaScript):** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Vite:** A fast and opinionated build tool that significantly improves the front-end development experience.

* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs directly in your markup.

* **Lucide React:** A beautiful, customizable icon library that provides the icons used throughout the application.


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
    cd [YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    This will install all necessary packages, including React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React.

3.  **Tailwind CSS Configuration:**
    Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` is correctly set up. 

    Also, make sure your main CSS file (e.g., `src/index.css`) includes the Tailwind directives at the top:

    ```css
    /* src/index.css */
    @import "tailwindcss";
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:----` .

## üí° Future Development

This project is a starting point, and I have several ideas for future enhancements:

* **Recurring Events:** Add support for creating recurring daily, weekly, or monthly events, and a daily checklist + stats and streaks.
* **Event Persistence:** Implement local storage or a database (e.g., Firebase Firestore) to save events so they persist across sessions.

* **User Accounts:** Add authentication to allow multiple users to have their own private schedules.

* **Notifications:** Integrate calendar notifications for upcoming events.

* **Drag-and-Drop:** Allow users to drag and drop events to reschedule them.

* **Customization:** More options for theme customization, event colors, etc.

* **Search Functionality:** Ability to search for specific events.
